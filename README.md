Install oh-my-zsh first:

Bootstrap with:
```
$ bash <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kelp/dotfiles/master/homeshick.sh)
```

# HOWTO / TODO
Various setup things that need to move into the bootstrap file and get 
automated. Need to integrate this with my older kelp-config bootstrap.

# Document / automate Font Install, I'm using hack-nerd-font

# install powerline-status
# OS X
pip install --user powerline-status
# neovim doesn't need to have python compiled in, but it does need
# this module
pip3 install --user neovim
